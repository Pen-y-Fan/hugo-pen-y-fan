Basic commands

### Create a post

To create a new post **index.md** in the **content/posts/2024/<post-name>/** directory. Note the kebab case (url
friendly) for the directory name.

Example:

```shell
hugo new posts/2024/how-to-update-the-php-version/index.md
```

Open content > 2024 > <post-name> to see index.md. Update the default layout as required.

The default layout has an image placeholder. Search [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), download the photo, create 
an **images** sub-folder, update the link and arbitration.

### Server

Use the hugo server to check the current state of the local site (-D includes draft pages)

```shell
hugo server -D
```

The website can be accessed from [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)

### Deploy

Once the new content has been checked, it is ready to be deployed:

1. check **draft: false** is set in the front matter
2. deploy the latest additions to the **public** directory:

```shell
hugo --minify
```

The **public** folder is configured as a git submodule, open in PhpStorm, commit and push the changes ðŸ˜€
