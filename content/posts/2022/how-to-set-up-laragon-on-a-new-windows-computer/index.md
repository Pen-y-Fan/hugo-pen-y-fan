Laragon is my developer environment of choice on Windows, this is how I set up Laragon on a new computer.
{{< /lead >}}

## Why Laragon?

I don't know exactly when I started using [Laragon](https://laragon.org), probably in 2018 or 2019, I had tried XAMPP and WAMP.
When I tried Laragon I never looked back. The speed of Laragon, the ability to switch PHP versions and auto-generated
pretty URLs are the key reasons.

When I create a new project Laragon automatically updates the Windows hosts with a pretty URL, and configures an Apache
.conf file and/or NGINX .conf file. The project can be viewed with its pretty URL which is automatically created from
the project's folder name.

To open any project website I can select Laragon, and click start. Laragon will start Apache (by default) and MySQL.
Then Laragon menu > www > select the project folder name. Laragon will launch my default browser and open the pretty URL
of the project. It's fast and the Laragon magic just works, allowing me to get on with my work!

If you need more reasons see [Why Lagaon](https://laragon.org/why-laragon/) on Largon's website. there are links to
check out the Testimonials, to see how other users think of Laragon and itâ€™s features page for more details.
