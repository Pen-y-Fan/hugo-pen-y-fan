This is my curated and opinionated list of what works for me, on how I try to keep up to date with what's going on in
software development and in particular PHP.

## Podcasts

I listen to a podcast every breakfast, I use the [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) Android app, which does an
excellent job downloading and playing my podcast selection. According to the stats I've listened to 13 days and 17 hours
of podcasts!

- [Pocket cast - Dev and F1 podcasts 2022](https://lists.pocketcasts.com/cae268b6-19f9-4c9a-a15c-7eaca12a8b3c) - my list
  of 20 podcasts.

## Newsletters

I subscribe to three newsletters, as you would expect many of the news is the same across the three, but each does have
a different slant. It doesn't take long to skim the similar content, they all have news, articles and tips.

- [Laravelnews newsletter](https://laravel-news.com/newsletter) is well worth Laravel developers subscribing
- [Laraveldaily weekly Laravel newsletter](https://laraveldaily.com/weekly-laravel-newsletter/) is also worthy for
  Laravel developers
- [PHP Weekly](https://www.phpweekly.com/) is another good newsletter to sign up for more PHP news too.

## YouTube

I have over 100 subscriptions, here are some noteworthy dev-related ones.

### Regularly watched

These are channels I have the **bell** icon notification and try to watch soon after receiving:

- [Laraveldaily](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaravelDaily/videos) with over 100k subscribers, with short daily tips and
  posts about Laravel. The daily videos are on my notifications and I watch them every day!
- [Stefan Mischook](https://www.youtube.com/c/StefanMischook/videos), over 200k subscribers, good tips for new
  developers wanting to learn how to start, he has his own [Studio web](https://www.studioweb.com/) site which is
  promoted
- [Brent Roose](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrenDtRoose/videos), Brent used to work for Spatie, now a developer
  advocate for PhpStorm, I've enjoyed the recent series on Generics

### Periodically watched

These are channels I periodically monitor, when I want to cheery pick something interesting to watch I have so many
choices (alphabetical)

- [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/c/derekbanas), over 1.1M subscribers, there are some detailed beginner courses
  on many languages, including the source code! I've just started watching the 3h 49m Golang course, out of interest

  about Xdebug then these videos are a must-watch

## Streaming

- [larastreamers archive](https://larastreamers.com/archive) has links to many recently streamed channels, the home page
  displays upcoming streams

## Learning

I have found [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) to be one of the best Laravel and PHP tutorial sites around, I now
understand the reason many people recommend it! The quality to top draw. I have not only watched over 400 episodes in
the last 8 months. I have put much of the information into practice!

## Documentation

- [PHP manual](https://www.php.net/manual), even after using PHP for years, the docs are frequently checked
- [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) if you are doing anything with Laravel review and bookmark the docs,
  they are invaluable
- [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/docs) I've found filament admin, tables and forms to be brilliant to work with,
  the documentation is superb
- [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs) is well worth a review before starting any Laravel-Livewire projects
- [Alpinejs](https://alpinejs.dev) for all the sprinkles that modern websites need take a look at Alpine docs
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) docs for the utility-first CSS framework, a must-read and bookmark
- [Mozilla Developer Network MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) this guide and documentation is
  first class for all things web, HTML, CSS, Javascript and many more

## Summary

I hope others find this curated and opinionated list useful
