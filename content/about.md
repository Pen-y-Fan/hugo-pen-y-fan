I am a father, husband and geek.

I have always enjoyed coding. My interested started when my uncle bought me a ZX Spectrum 48k when I was only 11! I'm
giving my age away there ðŸ˜‰.

From Oct 2015, I was an admin on the [Real Racing 3 Wiki](https://rr3.fandom.com/). This included updating the site,
using HTML, Wiki mark-up and designing templates. This allowed editors to enter high-quality data and display it in a
consistent layout. I introduced variables, which allowed tables to be automatically totalled and colour highlighting of
relevant data. I retired as an Admin Jan 2019, to concentrate on becoming a programmer.

After installing a PHP system called [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/), in 2017, my interest in programming was
rekindled. I self-studied since 2018 to learn full-stack development: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL/MySQL. I wrote
some web APIs, part-time, to integrate REDCap in the NHS.

My effort has paid off! In July 2020, I started as a full time software developer
at [Health Education and Improvement Wales (HEIW)](https://heiw.nhs.wales/), I have added over 800 pages to our website.
I have created several sites using [Silverstripe CMS](https://www.silverstripe.org/). After one of the developers left I
took ownership of several legacy sites, build with in house PHP frameworks. I am currently building an event booking and
planning app using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x) and the [TALL](https://tallstack.dev/) stack. 

I ðŸ’– being a software developer!
